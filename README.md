*****************************************
* LOADING THE GAME                      *
*****************************************
    Open the "index.html" file using your favorite web browser. I used the "Google Chrome" web browser to
        develop and test the game so I recommend using "Google Chrome" to play for best results (if possible).

*****************************************
* PLAYING THE GAME                      *
*****************************************
    The game will load and begin automatically. A player sprite will be randomly selected for you and you
        can begin to move around the game board as soon as you are ready using the arrow keys on your
        computer keyboard.

    The object of the game is to collect the gems that appear while avoiding touching the "bug" enemies.
        Also, be sure to stay out of the water or you will die!
    
    Each gem collected will earn you 100 points. Try to collect as many gems as you can and compete against
        your friends to see who can get the highest score before dying!

    If you touch a enemy, your score will reset back to zero and you will be reset to the bottom of the game
        board.

    That's it! Have fun!
